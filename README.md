# 👋🏽 Hi, I’m **Eline Chehin**
- 🎓 **Software engineering student**
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things!
- 📈 **Career Goal:** Aspiring to become a full stack Java developer and eager to learn more about front-end development.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eline-chehin-9a0308157/) | [Email](mailto:elinepine@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love go-karting. I used to do this professionally when I was younger.

## 💻 What I've learned so far
- **Core Programming Skills:** Strong understanding of variable types, user input/output, arithmetic and boolean operators. Skilled in conditionals, loops, arrays and ArrayLists.
- **Code Structure & Design:** Proficient in breaking down problems, structuring code with functions and converting functional descriptions into class diagrams. Knowledge of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Object-Oriented Development:** Experience with unit testing and code coverage principles. Comfortable with CRUD operations, event handling and GUI building in Android.
- **Tools & Technologies:** Proficient in IntelliJ, Android Studio, Visual Paradigm and Git.
- **Teamwork & Project Skills:** Familiar with iterative, feature-based development and able to contribute to team collaboration, problem analysis and creative solution-finding.
- **Research & Documentation:** Skilled in information sourcing, documenting designs and defining requirements to support application development.
- **Front-end Development:** Did a 5 Day Coding Challenge where I learned the very basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## 🌱 Currently learning
- **Design Patterns:** Applying patterns to improve application design.
- **Algorithm Development:** Solving complex problems through coding.
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Implementing optimized code with data structures.
- **Testing & Diagrams:** Performing system and integration tests; creating sequence and component diagrams to model systems.
- **Embedded Programming:** Controlling sensors and actuators with embedded programming.

## 🚧 Projects
- ☕ **Smart Coaster**: (Work in progress) A smart coaster that will let you know when your hot beverage is ready to drink. It will include setting a preferred temperature, using sound and light signals to indicate when the drink reaches that temperature, sending notifications to smart devices and providing an option to reheat the drink if it cools down too much. It consists of three key components: an Arduino microcontroller to read sensors and control actuators, a user application for data visualization and device control and a server application to manage data flow between the microcontroller, database and user app.

- 💥 **Omnibus**: Console application that allows users to manage a fictional world of superheroes and villains. Users can view and manage lists of heroes and villains including their gadgets, power levels and fans. The app also supports battles between heroes and villains, where factors like power levels, gadgets and fans determine the outcome.

- 🫧 **Cleaning Buddy**: An Android application that helps users manage household cleaning tasks. Users can assign tasks to specific rooms with customizable intervals (daily, weekly, or custom), view a list of pending tasks and mark them as complete. The app supports multiple users, allowing housemates to share and assign tasks. Additional features include task history, room management and password encryption.
