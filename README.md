# 👋🏽 Hi, I’m **Eline Chehin**
- 🎓 **Software engineering student**
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things!
- 🌱 Currently learning object oriented software engineering in Java and working on a **smart coaster project** with an **Arduino microcontroller**.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love go-karting. I used to do this professionally when I was younger.

## 🚧 Projects
- ☕ **Smart Coaster**: (Work in progress) A smart coaster that will tell you when your hot beverage is ready to drink. It will include setting a preferred temperature, using sound and light signals to indicate when the drink reaches that temperature, sending notifications to smart devices and providing an option to reheat the drink if it cools down too much. It consists of three key components: an Arduino microcontroller to read sensors and control actuators, a user application for data visualization and device control and a server application to manage data flow between the microcontroller, database and user app.

- 💥 **Omnibus**: Console application that allows users to manage a fictional world of superheroes and villains. Users can view and manage lists of heroes and villains including their gadgets, power levels and fans. The app also supports battles between heroes and villains, where factors like power levels, gadgets and fans determine the outcome.

- 🫧 **Cleaning Buddy**: An Android application developed in Java that helps users manage household cleaning tasks. Users can assign tasks to specific rooms with customizable intervals (daily, weekly, or custom), view a list of pending tasks and mark them as complete. The app supports multiple users, allowing housemates to share and assign tasks. Additional features include task history, room management and password encryption.
